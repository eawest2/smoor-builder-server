        "race_description": "History has always suggested that the Sylvan Fey are close relatives to the Elves of Tyrra, and sometimes are referred to as Wood Elves.\nWhile there may be some relation, it has been proven that this race is of a more magical sort.\nIt is assumed that the Sylvan Fey are a crossbred race of Elves and Faeries.\nMany scholars dismiss that origin in favor of the theory that the two share a common ancestor; yet what ancient race could have birthed so many and varied children?\nThe Sylvan Fey are craftsmen and lovers of art.\nThese warrior-poets are often as skilled with an ink quill as with a rapier.\nLight of heart and fond of adventure, you will always find a Sylvan Fey searching for something new.\n\n\n Make-Up and Costuming Requirements:\nA Sylvan Fey doesn't have any specific costuming requirements, but is required to wear horns.\nThese may be of latex, sculpting clay, or carved from wood.\nMake sure that your horns are a minimum of 1.5\" long and aren't sharp enough to cause injury.\nConsult a veteran player for tips on making your horns.\nSylvan Fey are not required to wear pointed ears, but may elect to do so if they wish.\nAll Sylvan Fey must have their makeup and/or costuming approved by a Race Marshal and/or the Head of Logistics during Character Creation at a SOLAR event.\n\n\nInherent Advantages:\nBecause of their Fey nature, this race has some command over mind-controlling magics and effects.\nSylvan Fey may purchase the Resist Charm/Charm Break skill.\nBecause of their creative nature, they may purchase any Craftsman skill for 1 Build Point.\nForesters from birth, Sylvan Fey start with the Woodland Lore skill at no build cost and are skilled archers, as such Sylvan Fey deal +2 damage with Bows (increasing base damage to “8 Normal”).\n\n\nInherent Disadvantages:\nDue to their frail nature, Sylvan Fey suffer -1 Starting Body Points and -5 to Maximum Body Points.\nTheir small size also limits the choice of combat arms.\n Two-Handed Sword and Two-Handed Blunt skills are unavailable to this race (Note: Sylvan Fey may purchase the Two-Handed Mastery skill, however, it only permits Mastery of Staff and Polearm).\nIt is unknown why the Sylvan Fey despise charming magic or effects so much, but they will never use any effect that removes free will from a being.\nPerhaps it has to do with the Unseeley…"

        "race_name": "Surface Elf",
        "race_description": "Often referred to as the \"High Elves\", this race is thought to be the closest descendants of the first Elven Nation.\nWhile typically smaller and weaker than humans, the Surface Elves excel at all they do.\nNatural longevity causes most Surface Elves to be patient and tranquil, but they are every bit as prone to the eccentricities of other races.\nPride is considered to be the greatest fault of the “High Elf”, and causes them the most problems.\n\n\n Make-Up Requirements:\n There is only one make-up requirement for Surface Elves: all characters must wear pointed ears.\n\n\nInherent Advantages:\nIt is thought that a relation to the Fey allows the Elven races to resist the effects of charming attacks or influences.\nAs such, each Elven character may purchase the Resist Charm skill.\nElves can also purchase the Resist Sleep skill due to their slowed metabolisms.\nThe Bow skill is a staple of their childhood education, as such Surface Elves deal +2 damage with them (increasing base damage to \"8 Normal\").\n\n\nInherent Disadvantages:\nFrail physique prevents the Surface Elf from purchasing the Two-Handed Blunt or Two-Handed Sword skills (Note: Surface Elves may purchase the Two-Handed Mastery skill, however, it only permits Mastery of Staff and Polearm).\nA second side effect of their lithe build is that they suffer -1 Starting Body Points and -5 to Maximum Body Points."
