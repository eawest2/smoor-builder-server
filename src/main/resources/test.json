        "race_description": "Often referred to as the \"High Elves\", this race is thought to be the closest descendants of the first Elven Nation.\nWhile typically smaller and weaker than humans, the Surface Elves excel at all they do.\nNatural longevity causes most Surface Elves to be patient and tranquil, but they are every bit as prone to the eccentricities of other races.\nPride is considered to be the greatest fault of the “High Elf”, and causes them the most problems.\n\n\n Make-Up Requirements:\n There is only one make-up requirement for Surface Elves: all characters must wear pointed ears.\n\n\nInherent Advantages:\nIt is thought that a relation to the Fey allows the Elven races to resist the effects of charming attacks or influences.\nAs such, each Elven character may purchase the Resist Charm skill.\nElves can also purchase the Resist Sleep skill due to their slowed metabolisms.\nThe Bow skill is a staple of their childhood education, as such Surface Elves deal +2 damage with them (increasing base damage to \"8 Normal\").\n\n\nInherent Disadvantages:\nFrail physique prevents the Surface Elf from purchasing the Two-Handed Blunt or Two-Handed Sword skills (Note: Surface Elves may purchase the Two-Handed Mastery skill, however, it only permits Mastery of Staff and Polearm).\nA second side effect of their lithe build is that they suffer -1 Starting Body Points and -5 to Maximum Body Points."
