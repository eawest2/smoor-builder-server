        "class_description": "The Templar is a warrior-mage and is perfect for those that wish to both fight and cast equally well.\nThough they are slower to progress in both combat ability and spells than their Warrior and Scholar counterparts, the balance of the two is liked by many but too slow to progress for others.\n At any rate, Templars make some of the most formidable opponents around, providing you with the unexpected in both their casting and combat ability.\nPhysically, the Templar is equal to the Rogue with fifty (50) maximum Body Points and is only restricted to wearing twenty-five (25) armor points."
